# Full Stack Application
A small project intended to represent an enrolment system for a university. Each major has an N:N relationship with courses, i.e. a major can offer many courses, and a course can be offered by many majors. Courses have a 1:N relationship with students, i.e. a course can have many students enrolled into it, and a student can be enrolled in only one course. 

The backend was built with Ruby on Rails, while the frontend was built with React.
